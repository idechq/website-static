          <p><strong>(1) Best Hardware</strong></p>
          <p>To reward the most original hardware design. The hardware should improve the convenience of directed
            evolution through innovative design, including improving efficiency, simplifying operations, reducing costs,
            etc. </p>
          <p><strong>(2) Best Software</strong></p>
          <p>To reward the most original software design. The software should improve the convenience of directed
            evolution through innovative design, including improving efficiency, simplifying operations, reducing costs,
            etc. </p>
          <p><strong>(3) Best Algorithm</strong></p>
          <p>To reward the most original algorithm, which has universal significance for improving the predictability of
            directed evolution. </p>
          <p><strong>(4) Best target molecule </strong></p>
          <p>To reward the most exciting target molecule selection. </p>
          <p><strong>(5) The most potential tool </strong></p>
          <p>To reward the most novel directed evolution tool, which is currently proved to have no advantages but has
            the potential to be further optimized. </p>
          <p><strong>(6) Best community building (Executive Committee Award) </strong></p>
          <p>To reward the team that has made the most significant contributions to the iDEC community building.</p>
          <p><strong>(7) Best Presentation </strong></p>
          <p>To reward for presentation with precise logic, attractive and impressive content.</p>
          <p><strong>(8) Best Wiki</strong></p>
          <p>The iDEC wiki will focus on introducing science to the public. This award rewards the most creative
            scientific promotion content.</p>
          <p><strong>(9) Funniest Evolution </strong></p>
          <p>To reward the funniest research topic. </p>
          <p><strong>(10) Industry advisory group award</strong></p>

          <p>Besides the above awards,iDEC also offers special awards. Special awards will be given to teams that make
            outstanding accomplishments in a particular field.</p>
          <p style="color: red;">Each special award can be given to more than one team in iDEC.</p>

          <p><strong>Mysterious Award 1</strong></p>
          <p>A reporter system is commonly used in biology research to quantify biological activity, especially in
            genetic engineering. Designing and choosing an appropriate reporter system can facilitate the screening and
            identification process in directed evolution. Inspired by the 2008 Nobel prize in chemistry, iDEC presents
            an award to teams who develop or optimize a reporter system and use it in their iDEC projects.</p>
          <p><strong>Mysterious Award 2</strong></p>
          <p>The discovery of Taq polymerase from <i>Thermus aquaticus</i> brought a revolutionary method to the field
            of molecular biology. In directed evolution, error-prone PCR is typical to create mutations in target genes
            for constructing the library, which shows the importance of diversification tools. Thus, iDEC presents an
            award to teams that optimize or establish novel methods for genetic diversification in their research.</p>
          <p><strong>Mysterious Award 3</strong></p>
          <p>Screening and selecting the mutants with desired phenotypes from the mutated library is crucial in directed
            evolution. Thus, iDEC presents an award to teams who establish or optimize screening assays in their
            projects.</p>
