          <p>Diversity is found in any social identity such as gender or identifying as non-binary, age, nationality,
            ethnicity, culture, political belief, religion or the lack of religion, sexual orientation, and other
            attributes. At iDEC we aim to create a community for directed evolution researchers where everyone is
            welcome and feels free to be themselves. We want to involve, accept, and value everyone regardless of their
            social identity. We strongly believe that creating an open and diverse (research) community is the only way
            to solve the problems of both the present and the future. We expect all teams to foster a team culture where
            every voice is welcome, respected, and heard.</p>
          <p>We from iDEC HQ want to encourage everyone with an interest in directed evolution to join our community
            and/or competition. If you feel like any structures in your home institution, country or team are holding
            you back to do so, please contact us!</p>

          <p>When you recruit your team, make sure the team reflects the diverse background of your area. If you only
            receive applications from a non-diverse group (e.g., gender), seek contact with potential candidates and ask
            them what the barriers are that prevent them from wanting to join your team. Try to remove these barriers
            together!</p>
          <p>Words matter! And graphics, too! Have you ever thought about gender-neutral language? Or if your standard
            representation in pictures and graphics of a scientist is diverse? Language and representation have a huge
            influence on how (and if) people feel approached. Would you answer a job application you think is only
            searching for people of another gender? Always try to write with gender-neutral language and highlight that
            you and your team support building a project that is beneficial for the whole society.</p>
          <p>Get in contact and discuss. As scientists, we rarely learn how to build a diverse and inclusive community,
            definitely less than people studying other subjects, but this does not mean that it is less important in our
            community. If you feel like you do not understand why someone feels offended, ask this person. Only an open
            dialogue can change our community to become better when it comes to diversity and inclusion. This is true
            for the iDEC HQ as well: if you feel like something is wrong or missing on this page, please contact us!</p>

          <p>To participate in iDEC, you and your team must fill out a responsible research form. This will address

          <p>In your responsible research form, you will need to answer some questions regarding biosafety,

          <p>Aspects of biosecurity are information security, access control, and inventory control.</p>
          <p>Biosafety and biosecurity measures are often closely related. For example, efforts to prevent unintentional
            release of biological material (an aspect of biosafety) often prevent intentional release (biosecurity) as
            well. Thus, biosecurity countermeasures are usually covered by biosafety laws. However, additional
            regulations related to biosecurity with hazardous organisms have been implemented to prevent their misuse.

          <p>To illustrate the difference between biosafety and biosecurity, the Biosecurity Office of the Dutch
            National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) made the following distinction: "With
            biosafety, people are protected against dangerous pathogens, while with biosecurity, the pathogens are

          <p>In some experiments, the biosafety level of the organism we use can be changed by engineering traits of

          <p>If you identify a risk of GOF of your experiments, please contact the Commission for Responsible Research.
            Keep in mind that this does not only include expected increase in virulens; even engineering of e. g.

          <p>Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) is a part of biosecurity. When thinking about Dual Use Research of
            Concern, research on pathogens is probably the first thing that comes to mind. Some organisms which are
            known to be a threat to human health and security are listed as “selected agents”<a
              href="https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/dsat/what-is-select-agents.htm#:~:text=Select%20agents%20are%20biological%20agents,to%20animal%20or%20plant%20products">[5]</a>.
            These include, for example, pathogens like the ebola virus<a
              href="https://www.selectagents.gov/sat/list.html ">[6]</a>.</p>
          <p>But even research based on non-selected agent organism can have a potential of misuse. An example would be
            viruses to engineer traits of agricultural plants on the field. Designing a vector that can engineer a whole
            field to become e.g. drought resistant, might be misused to introduce traits that destroy entire crops or
            introduce toxin production.</p>
          <p>This webpage is not meant to spread panic or evoke the image that directed evolution research is too
            dangerous. Most projects have a very low potential of causing harm, but even if the potential to harm is low
            for most projects, identification of risks is crucial to establish precautions. Right now, we rely on the
            self-regulatory approach when it comes to some biosecurity issues (e.g. DURC), meaning all researcher are
            responsible to screen for risks and establish precautions themselves. Regulations by an external body would
            restrict the right of free research, but to make this approach work, we need to ensure that every researcher
            has the skills to determine biosafety and biosecurity risks and the best way to do so is a good education on
            these issues.</p>
          <p>We are aware that many educational institutions still did not include such teaching programs in their
            curricula globally.</p>

          <p>Identifying ethical issues of scientific research projects is a big part of responsible research. To
            identify possible unethical practices, teams need to evaluate who is impacted by their project and what this
            influence means to the person, group, or society as a whole. If you have any questions regarding your
            project's ethical implications, we would recommend contacting your university's or institutional ethics
            council or contacting our Commission for Responsible Research (CRR).</p>
          <p>It is important to get clearance through your ethics council if you want to conduct any research on humans
            or human samples, including surveys.</p>
          <p>It is also helpful to get in touch with people affected by your research and ask them how they would
            envision a solution for their problem. Designing projects hand in hand with the people who will use them
            later will help you develop a beneficial product.</p>
          <p>To analyze a project's societal and environmental context is often referred to as "Human Practices". The
            term "Human Practices" was first coined by the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (Synberc) as a
            defining part of its policy and practices thrust. <a href="https://ebrc.org/synberc/">[7]</a> </p>
          <p>iDEC is committed to communicating the importance of considering ethical implications.</p>

          <p>The responsible research form aims to check that your team considers possible risks and establishs
            suitable countermeasures.</p>
          <p><strong>Please submit your form before July 1.</strong></p>
          <p>For the responsible research form, all teams must answer questions in the following categories: Laboratory
            biosafety, used chassis and genes, biosecurity and ethical concerns (including research on humans).</p>
          <p>The responsible research form can be submitted on a rolling basis but must be submitted by each team
            before they start with their wetlab work and latest July 1. The responsible research forms will be
            reviewed and approved by the commission for responsible research. If a team wants to use additional genes,
            chemicals, methods or chassis that have not yet been mentioned in the responsible research form, they can
            send a request to get these genes approved by the commission for responsible research.</p>
          <p>Your team will get a link to fill out the Responsible Research Form online. If you want to have a look at
            the questions, you can download the Responsible Research Form as .pdf document here:</p>
