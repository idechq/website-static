              medals are specially designed and cast each year, reflecting the theme of the event. These medals will be
              engraved with the name of each winner, making them truly unique. This year, the design of the iDEC medals
              pays homage to the 70th anniversary of the discovery of the DNA structure. The medals will be presented to
              the awardees during the awards ceremony and later sent back to the manufacturer for engraving the names of
              the winners.</p>

              will be held on-site at Fitzwilliam College, University of Cambridge. In addition to the teams
              participating in iDEC this year, iDEC Festival 2023 will also be open to past participants who were unable
              to experience the on-site event due to the pandemic. We believe this will provide a unique opportunity for
              all contestants to come together and celebrate the spirit of innovation and achievement. We eagerly
              anticipate the participation of teams from around the world, as they bring their innovations and
              accomplishments to this ancient town, rich with scientific history.</a>
